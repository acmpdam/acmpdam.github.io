    <h1>PROBLEM 1: Weighted Graph Traversal</h1>
    <h2>Contributed by Edward Pryor</h2>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    <p>A graph is a collection of nodes, also called vertices, connected by edges. 
    A graph is considered weighted if the edges have a value associated with them. 
    A graph is considered directed if each edge imposes a directional restraint, 
	that is, you may travel from node A to node B, but not the other way around.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Task</h3>

    <p>Write a program to find the lowest cost path through a graph from a denoted 
    start node to a specific end node. You do not need to visit all the nodes in the graph.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, in the following graph:</p> <br>

    <img src="images/Problem1.png" alt="Problem 1"> <br>
    
    <p>The least cost path from A to E would be A, C, D, E, with a cost of 12. 
    Note that this path is longer in the number of hops than A, C, E, but path 
    A, C, E, has a weight of 14, and therefore is more expensive.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Input</h3>
    
    <p>Your program should accept its input from standard in. Format the input 
    so that each line of input represents a Node and all the edges leading from 
    it along with their weights. The first line is assumed to be the start node, and 
    the last line will be the destination node. Signal the end of your input with a 
    line containing only the * character. As an example, the graph above 
    would be input in the following way:</p>
    
    <p>A B5 C5</p>
    <p>B C1 D7</p>
    <p>C D3 E9</p>
    <p>D E4</p>
    <p>E</p>

    <p>*Keep one space between each entry in the line, and I recommend using 
    split parse the input.</p>
    
    <p>There will be no space between a node and its weight, so 'B5' describes the 
    edge to B with a weight of 5. Because it was on the 'A' line, that edge came 
    from node A. Alphabetical order of input should not matter.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Output</h3>
    
    <p>Print the path of nodes you found to standard out along with the weight you 
    calculated. The above graph would produce "A C D E 12" as its output.</p>
